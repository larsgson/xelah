# XELAH: Simple Text Editor for React

XELAH is a collection of libraries that build on top of each other.

A series of react components to be used with the ste-core to customize the rendering of STE using MUI.

### @xelah/ui-tailwind

### @xelah/type-usfm

A precursor to ste-perf-html, STE USFM is an implementation that is a starting point to edit raw USFM files.

### @xelah/type-markdown

A markdown implementation that is not comprehensive but a starting point that could use contributions.
